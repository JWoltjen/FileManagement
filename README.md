# FileManagement

GOAL

Using C#, copy all of the files from one folder to
another folder. Do not overwrite existing files.
Ensure that all sub-folders and files are copied as well.

BONUS

Include a switch in your method that allows you to
flatten the file structure (all in one folder). When
doing so, rename the files to include the folder names
like so: Folder1_FileName.txt if it came from the
subfolder Folder1.
